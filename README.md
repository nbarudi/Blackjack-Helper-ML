# Blackjack Hands Machine Learning Project

This project uses machine learning to analyze and predict outcomes of Blackjack hands and build a neural network to predict the outcome of a hand based on the cards dealt.

## Overview

The project uses a dataset, [[`blkjckhands.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojocolors/900000-hands-of-blackjack-results)] containing information about various Blackjack hands. The goal is to train a machine learning model to predict the outcome of a hand based on the cards dealt.

## Features

- Data exploration and preprocessing: The project includes scripts for exploring and preprocessing the `blkjckhands.csv` dataset.
- Model training: The project includes scripts for training a machine learning model on the preprocessed data.
- Model evaluation: The project includes scripts for evaluating the model's performance and tuning its hyperparameters.
